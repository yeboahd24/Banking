# CentralBank

This is a Banking web-app I created as a part of my Engineering curriculum.

## Features
<li> Create new account and get a unique account number on sign-in.
<li> Store and edit your details.
<li> Transfer (fictitious) money from one bank account to another.


## Prerequisites
1. A Terminal (preferred) or a CMD
2. Python 3.4 or above installed. (Windows users might need to [add it to path](https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path).)
3. Django framework 1.8 or above installed and working.

## Installation
1. Open a Terminal, and clone the current repository.

2. Enter the root directory.

    ```

3. Now start the setup by entering the following command.

### Disclaimer
This app represents a  fictitious bank. All transactions, account numbers and account holdings are unreal.
